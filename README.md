# GLOBAL SOLUTION - BLUE FUTURE

This project aims to ensure that human activities in the oceans are ecologically responsible, socially inclusive, and economically sustainable in the long term. For this, it is essential to adopt effective environmental management practices, develop innovative technologies, and promote close collaboration between governments, companies, and local communities.

The oceans face significant challenges, such as the destruction of marine habitats, pollution, and climate change. These problems not only affect marine ecosystems but also have a direct impact on the global economy.

## üî® Project Functionalities

This site is composed of five distinct pages:

- Home: Presents an overview of the project and highlights its importance.
- Corals: Explains in detail the relevance of corals to marine ecosystems and to humanity.
- Monitoring: Describes the methods and technologies used to monitor the health and growth of corals.
- Replanting: Provides information about coral replanting initiatives, including the techniques and collaborative efforts involved.
- Contribution: Informs how people can support and participate in the project, whether through donations, volunteering, or other forms of involvement.

### Home

On this page, we briefly present the innovative idea conceived by our group to face one of the major problems of our oceans: the death of coral reefs. The page includes a video created and edited by our group, which explains the problem we propose to solve, identifies the target audience and potential customers, describes the solution we offer, highlights the differential of our approach, and points out the projected revenue sources.

In addition, the page mentions the members of our group, with links to their LinkedIn profiles, allowing visitors to learn more about the qualifications and experiences of the team members.

### Corals

On this page, we offer detailed explanations about the importance of coral reefs to the world, highlighting their crucial roles in various areas. The page includes an interactive map that shows the regions where corals exist, detailing the importance of the reefs in each specific selected area. The map also provides information about governance and presents key numbers, such as the total area of coral reefs, the proportion in relation to the rest of the world, and other relevant data.

### Monitoring

On this page, we explain the crucial importance of monitoring coral reefs. We detail how monitoring helps to protect and conserve these vital ecosystems, allowing early detection of problems and the implementation of corrective measures. We describe the different types of monitoring used.

### Replanting

On this page, we discuss studies on super reefs, exploring how they work and how they can be used for coral replanting in other areas. We explain the concept of super reefs. We detail the characteristics that make these reefs so robust and the factors that contribute to their resilience. We describe how super reefs can be used as a source of corals for replanting in degraded areas. We explain the process of selecting and collecting coral fragments from these resilient reefs.

### Contribution

On this page, we highlight the various ways in which a person can contribute to the project and help preserve the oceans and coral reefs. We offer different levels of financial support, each with its respective benefits. In addition to monetary contributions, we mention other forms of support. We highlight the importance of community involvement and how each action, no matter how small, can make a big difference in preserving the oceans and coral reefs.
